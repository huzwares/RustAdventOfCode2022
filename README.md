# Advent of Code 2022 - Rust Solutions

Welcome to my repository for Advent of Code 2022! Here, you'll find my simple and easy-to-read solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 challenges, all implemented in the Rust programming language without any external dependencies.

Currently, this repository contains solutions for the ***first 11 days*** of Advent of Code 2022. I'll be gradually adding solutions for the remaining days as I progress through the event.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event that takes place in December. It consists of 25 daily challenges, each revealing a new problem to solve. Participants from all over the world engage in solving these puzzles, and it's a great opportunity to learn, practice, and have fun with programming!

## Motivation

The main motivation behind this repository is to document my learning journey with Rust. As a Rust enthusiast, I'm currently in the process of mastering the language and exploring its powerful features. Participating in Advent of Code 2022 provides an excellent opportunity for me to tackle diverse programming challenges and enhance my problem-solving skills.

Throughout this learning adventure, I aim to follow best practices in Rust development and keep the codebase clean and approachable. By sharing my solutions, I hope to connect with the community and learn from fellow Rustaceans who may provide valuable feedback and suggestions.

## How to Use

You are welcome to explore the solutions in this repository to learn from them or get inspiration for your own implementations. Each day's solution is implemented in a single file named after the day number. To run the solution, place the corresponding puzzle input in an "input.txt" file in the root directory of your cargo project (or in the same place if you use rustc).

## Contributing

As the solutions in this repository aim to be simple and dependency-free, contributions are welcome if they align with this philosophy. If you'd like to add a new solution or improve an existing one, feel free to open a pull request. Before doing so, please make sure your changes follow the established style and structure.
